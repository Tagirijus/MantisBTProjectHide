# MantisBT Project Hide

## About

ATTENTION: Plugin still in development and it does not work!

This plugin just hides the inactive projects in the manage projects page table. Disable plugin to show the projects again.

## Ideas

When I dig deeper into MantisBT plugin development, there might be a configuration page on which you can show the projects. Or maybe the plugin even alters the `manag_proj_page.php` so that there will be two tables: one with active and one with inactive projects.
